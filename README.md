#  RFM Customer Segmentation Project

This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** using Python and Power BI to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

---

##  Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – for data preparation, RFM scoring, and exporting segmentation
- **Power BI** – for interactive visualization of customer segments

##  Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Load and clean transactional data  
2. **RFM Scoring** – Score customers based on:
   - **Recency** – How recently they purchased
   - **Frequency** – How often they purchase
   - **Monetary** – How much they spend
3. **Segmentation** – Assign customers to groups like:
   - Champions
   - Loyal Customers
   - At Risk
   - Hibernating
   - Lost
4. **Visualization** – Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI

##  Business Impact

-  Personalized campaigns based on customer segment
-  Reduce churn for "At Risk" customers
-  Increase revenue from "Loyal" and "Potential Loyalist" customers

---

##  Sample Insights

- Segment distribution using bar chart
- Top 5 segments by customer count
- Segment-wise value contribution
